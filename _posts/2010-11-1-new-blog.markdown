Well after several months without posts in crosvera.blogspot.com and lose all
my codes from a free-web-hosting (0fees.net), I decided start a new blog but now
from the [GitHub Page system][1]. This service is awesome, because you can use
a git repository to manage your blog and use the MarkDown systax (and others) to
write your posts. (very l33t style heh...)

Well, I hope to write some new stuff soon.
