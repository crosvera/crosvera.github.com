Here we go again. After several months (years?) whitout any interest in posting,
I got an assignment in a Linux class, I have to write a serie of post about
basic administration commands.

In this first post, I will write for you about basic user managing.


** The `useradd' command
This is the command to designed -as the name says- to add new users to the system
It can be found in every Unix-like operating system (Linux for example).

At first look, its basis syntax is:

    useradd [options] username

if we run `useradd' without any argument, it will show a brief explanation of its
options.
